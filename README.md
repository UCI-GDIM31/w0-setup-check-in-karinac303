# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. My name is Karina, I go by any pronouns, and I like to play competitive shooter games (only with friends), cozy games like Stardew, and visual novels. Im taking this class because it is part of my requirements. I have made games before in my Highschool design class, through the engine, Construct 3. I hope to build functional games that are actually entertaining, haha.  

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [0] Game Design & Interactive Media


3. I hope to gain experience working in unity, as it is a program I have always wanted to try but never got the chance to.
4. I am not extremely nervous about the class, more excited to learn about a new language and program!

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming: A little bit of Java, I can understand basic coding concepts.

2. Game development: Construct 3

3. Unity: N/a

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document: n/a

2. Scope management: Public vs Private code, how far someone or a variable can be used within the code, like locally (within the line of code, or throughout the entire class.

3. Iteration: Repeating code, looping.

4. Object-Oriented programming: n/a
